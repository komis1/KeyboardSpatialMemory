# Learning to Type on Mobile Keyboards: A Theory on the Formation of Spatial Memory

Typing on mobile soft keyboards is an acquired skill that users learn through experience. Previous research has modelled learning of keyboard layouts via statistical approximation of the probability of correct recall of a target's (key) location from long and short-term memory, however, there are no insights as to how the mental model of the keyboard may be formed inside the brain. We construct a theory that could explain this process sufficiently, highlighting the importance of mental landmarks for efficient storage and recall of spatial information. The theory is explored and validated through simulation of a cognitive architecture and comparison with extant empirical data, generating insights that could inform the design of new layouts and facilitate the learning process for novice users.
